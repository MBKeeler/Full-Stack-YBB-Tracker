## README for front-end: Youth Baseball Evaluation Tracker:

As a member and volunteer of my youth Baseball league we need a better way of
tracking the performance of our players at our evaluation.  Right now we use
paper and must then reconcile all of the individual sheets to get a view of
player performance before we can decide which levels of play are appropriate.
The goal of this project will be to provide an option for entering data and then
review the players and their scores.
